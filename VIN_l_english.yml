 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy:0 "Encourage Inter-Party Democracy"
 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the existence of a single revolutionary party, it must be open to different ways of approaching and developing Vietnamese socialism.

 VIN_vietnams_tridemism_desc:0 "The VNQDD was strongly inspired by Kuomintang and in particular its founder, Sun Yat-Sen. Among his many ideas, his three principles of the people are among the most important. What can be done in China can also be done here, so we will apply its ideals in our new republic."
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments:0 "Establish The Regionals Parliaments"
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc:0 "A good way to help in local representation would be to create a parliament for each of Vietnam's three regions: Cochin China, Annam and Tonkin. This parliament would be just below the federal parliament in terms of power, and could take decisions, particularly on the budget."
