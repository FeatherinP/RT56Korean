By the time of Munich, Czechoslovakia had actually one of the best equipped armies in the world and supposedly the highest number of automatic weapons per soldier (1/7).\n\nThe vz.24 rifle, based on the reliable Mauser (7,92mm) design was the standard issue infantry weapon of Czechoslovak army and later also SOS (State Defense Guard) units. It was manufactured by Zbrojovka Brno and by [GetDateText], 762.000 vz. 24 rifles were ready for mobilization along with 424,9 mil. pieces of ammunition with another 141,7 mil. stockpiled by ŘOP for storage in border fortifications.\n\nThe forefather of the famous Bren gun, the ZB vz. 26 machine gun (7,92mm), was the standard weapon for both infantry support units as well as light and heavy fortifications. Based on early 1920s design by V. Holek the weapon or its licensed production was exported to several countries, including UK or China. By 1936, 34.557 weapons were available for the army and several thousands were ordered for fortifications.\n\nThe TK vz. 37 heavy machine gun was the refinement of the previously used vz. 35. It was used as a squad support weapon, as a mounted machine gun for tanks and other armoured vehicles, and on fixed positions inside Czechoslovak border fortifications. Much like other Czech weapons, it also used 7,92mm ammo for easier supply and storage inside heavy forts. A licensed version of this weapon was produced in the UK as the Besa machine gun.\n\nFor some reason though, the army leadership was not interested in introduction of sub machine guns, although a modern prototype of a weapon later known as Samopal vz. 38 existed since 1937.\n\nAlmost all of the equipment was 'bought' (stolen) by the Germans after the 1939 occupation and by some modest estimates could be used to equip about the half of then Wehrmacht.

However, this did not stop Tatra from developing its own prototypes of armoured vehicles and even experimental tanks apart from the traditional car, truck and locomotive production.\n\nDuring World War II Tatra was instrumental in the production of trucks, and tank engines for the German war effort and the famous T 111 was born. This three-axle heavy truck with a directly air-cooled twelve-cylinder diesel engine remained in production for the 16 years.\n\nAnother successful design, the Tatra 87 car was supposedly popular amongst German officers during World War II for its superior speed and handling it offered for use on the Autobahn. Both Hitler and Porsche were influenced by the Tatras. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.\n\nMany German officers met their deaths driving heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle.

As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.\n\nWhen the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, the Legions started a slow evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. These men literally travelled around the world before they finally reached to their new, independent homeland.\n\nAfter their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new Czechoslovak Army. In fact They accounted for approximately one third of all men in the newly created army but absolutely prevailed in the high command. Almost all generals were legionaries, especially those from Russia.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Association of Legionnaires was founded in 1921 by merging of various legionaire organizations from all the battlefields of the first world war."

Ludvík Krejčí (on the picture) was chosen. His appointment presented a viable compromise for most political parties as well as the army circles.\n\nHowever, several other strong candidates were also considered. For a moment, even the head of French Military Mission, Gen. Faulcher was a candidate, but this would be a step back so this option was not passable by the Czech political representation.\n\nOne of the most interesting choices was Gen. Lev Prchala, the former Vice Chief of Staff under Gen. Syrový. He was principled and energetic man, open to the ideas of modern warfare and advocate of mobile maneuvers over static defense. His main 'weakness' was his German wife, something his opponents used strongly against him and what made him unacceptable choice for a Chief of Staff.\n\nDuring the Munich crisis, Prchala was the commander of the IV. Army that defended South Moravia. He was strongly against surrendering Sudetenland and his views eventually led to his repudiation by E. Beneš during the WW2. He remained in exile after the war and worked together with the Sudeten German organizations that were established after the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia.\n\nThere exists an interesting rumour is about his alleged participation in a never realized military coup attempt. According to the memories of his son, he repented his whole life that he did not shoot president Beneš during the Munich Crisis.\n\nAnother serious candidate was Gen. Vojtìch Luža, then head of the War College in Prague and a proponent of offensive armoured warfare based on ideas and tactics of French Marshals Foche and Ludendorff and German General Guderian.

Thümmel also delivered details over "military capabilities, and intentions" as well as "detailed information on the organization and structure of the Abwehr and SD along with "the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans". Later he also supposedly gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland as well as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nIn October, 1941 the Gestapo accused SS Paul Thümmel of tipping off Yugoslavian officials about Germany's April, 1941 attack on their country. They also suspected him of collaborating with Czech resistance leader Captain Vaclav Moravek. Thummel regularly supplied the Abwehr with classified SS information. Therefore, chief of Abwehr Admiral Canaris, stepped forward to defending him as an Abwehr double-agent.\n\nHistorians still debate whenever Agent A-54 was really some double agent 'ace', or just an elaborate ploy by Abwehr to feed misinformation to the Czechoslovak Intelligence and allies. Nevertheless, Thummel was eventually caught, charged with treason and later killed by the SS at Theresienstadt concentration camp in April 1945."

When the war was over, Pellé was experiencing a period of great popularity among the Czechoslovak public.\n\nUnder the General’s command, the Czechoslovak army proved its combat readiness and regained its honor. Pellé intended to use this in his favor when promoting his concept of a permanent Czechoslovak army as part of the Allied army. He intended to reflect this in the new Czechoslovak National Defense Act, which he essentially achieved in 1920 and the first Czechoslovak military academy was inaugurated in October of 1920 with the goal to train domestic high-ranking officers.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, General Pellé led the French mission in Czechoslovakia since the beginning of 1919 until the end of 1920, i.e. for almost two years. As a soldier and diplomat, he fully understood his unique position in Czechoslovakia: that of an intermediary between Czechoslovakia and France. Several times, Pellé backed Czechoslovakia, risking the disapproval of his French superior. He also had personal reasons for this, because he met his future wife in Prague, whom he married in 1921.\n\nGeneral Eugène Mittelhausser replaced Pellé in 1921 and served as the head of the military mission until 1926 when he was replaced by Louis Eugene Faucher that held the position until 1938.\n\nThe Treaty of Alliance and Friendship between France and Czechoslovakia was signed on January 25, 1924, in Paris."

During the 1920s the three nations sought economic and political cooperation and negotiated alliances with France.\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler assumed power in 1933, the members of the Little Entente created a Permanent Secretariat and a Permanent Council, composed of their foreign ministers, that met three times a year to direct a common policy. Nevertheless, during the 1930s the three states increasingly adopted independent foreign policies, especially after Germany occupied the Rhineland in spring of 1936 and the French support, upon which the entente relied, lost much of its value.\n\nHistorically, the entente lost its remaining political significance when in April 1937 both Yugoslavia and Romania denied a request by Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, that the entente pledge full military aid to a member that was the victim of aggression. The entente finally collapsed when Germany annexed the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia in September 1938."

The final decision was made at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919. Czech delegation was led by the prime minister Karel Kramář and foreign minister Edvard Beneš. They tried hard to persuade the Allies that the Czechoslovakia should have its historic crownland borders.\n\nWhilst the negotiations over Ruthenia and Upper Hungary were successful, the Czech delegation had to withdraw in many cases, for example in the matter of Kladsko, Lusatia or a corridor to the Yugoslavia.\n\nLusatia had specific role in that political play for territorial claims, as there existed relatively strong Lusatian national movement, demanding autonomy within Germany or incorporation to the new Czechoslovak republic. The question of Lusatia was not of vital importance for Czechoslovak diplomats and without transparent support of Czechoslovak state the unofficial Lusatian delegation at the Peace Conference was not able to put the Lusatian demands through the Conference´s agenda. Nevertheless, good relations between the Czechs and the Sorbs continued during the First Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nHistorically, the Lusatia region became part of Prussia at the Vienna Congress in 1815. In spite of germanization, the original Slavic language of the people known as Sorbs or Wends was preserved to a certain extent. During the 19th century a Sorbian Seminary was founded in Prague to support students from Lusatia.\n\nAfter World War II, the people of Lusatia attempted to become part of Czechoslovakia, but the Allies did not support their efforts."

Sokol members also actively participated in the "czechization" of ethnic Germans in the border regions and special German language islands and generally share the responsibility with other Czech and German associations for the resulting national hatred between Czechs and Germans in the interwar period.\n\nSokol was almost liquidated three times and was banned by all totalitarian regimes in Czechoslovak history. Firstly, Sokol was banned 1915 during the World War I. Secondly, it happened during the Nazi occupation of Czech lands. Finally, Sokol was banned by the communists after 1948.

However, the anti-german focus of the law further escalated the ethnic conflict and was actually one of the reasons why United Kingdom refused to support Czechoslovakia during the Sudetenland crisis and effectively sided with Hitler (Lord Runciman Mission).\n\nOne of the (many) controversies of the law was the definition of so called "state unreliable persons". Such person had a number of restrictions, for example was not allowed to run business of strategic importance or to receive important public contracts, but could also be laid off from employment without any justification.\n\nFurthermore, the authorities were not oblidged to give any reasons for their decision in this matter and thus it was premissible to issue such decision without any justification. Judical review of "unreliable person status" was not possible. All this made the law highly abuseable.\n\nThe act also permitted the government in a time of national emergency to impose tight controls on all industrial enterprises that it deemed important to the country's security.\n\nAlthough one cannot deny the legitimacy of the effort to ensure Czechoslovakia can adequately defend itself from external threats, the law stepped far beyond what is permissible in a democratic constitutional state.\n\nQuite ironically, the State Defense act proved an effective instrument for the Wehrmacht after the 1939 occupation. It allowed for the quick seizure of the armaments industry of the newly established Protectorate.\n\nOne German armament expert supposedly called it "one of the best laws on war economy in Central Europe" and "an exemplar of tight organization concentrated in one hand" to effectively control all branches important for arms production.\n\nThe Minister of National Defense, František Machník, was amongst the greatest proponents of the State Defense Act."

The Sudeten Germans responded by increasing political radicalisation.\n\nThe concomitant ascension of the pan-Germanic Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1933, with his rhetoric of uniting all Germans across Europe against the perfidy and 'oppression' of the Slavs, greatly gravitated the Sudeten Germans towards racialist and far-right nationalism. Quickly, the vast majority of Sudeten Germans called for almost complete autonomy or even independence from Czechoslovakia and possible merger into the Third Reich. The leading vanguard of the pan-Germanist movement was the Sudeten German Party (SdP) of Konrad Henlein.\n\nThe peaceful coexistence between Czechs and Germans in Czechoslovakia was always a matter of a relatively small part of the German and Czech population under the leadership of individual politicians. In the tense period of early 1938 waves of extreme nationalism on both sides aggravated the situation.\n\n It should be noted that the concessions made by the Czechoslovak government in late 1938 would be most likely enough for the Sudeten Germans would they have been implemented before 1938.\n\nUnfortunately, the reforms and autonomy laws drafts came at a point of no return and could not change anything. Hitler was determined on the destruction of Czechoslovakia and Henlein's SdP and the escalated ethnic conflict was crucial to his plans."

The newly established defense guard had three main tasks, to protect the border, to keep the order and rule of the law and to support executions of customs duty.\n\nMembers of the guard were local policemen, existing finance guards and members of state police. Later citizens loyal to Czechoslovakia were incorporated (for example many members of sports organisation Sokol or active anti-fascist Germans). Plans were created to support the guard with regular army units to handle local conflicts.\n\nPlanned size of the service were 38 battalions, but only 31 had been mustered (one of these inland, in Prague). Their equipment were pistols, rifles, light machine guns and grenades.\n\nAs the tensions between Czechoslovakia, local Germans and Nazi Germany grew up the guard was deployed on the border during May 1938 and stayed there until end of September, when Sudetenland was ceded to Germany. During September the guard fought low level warfare with local German partisans (Sudetendeutsches Freikorps) and commandos from Germany. After the loss of borderland SOS moved inland on new positions.

In some Czech sources the conflict is described as the 'Seven-day war' because of its quick conclusion.\n\nThe chief importance of Cieszyn Silesia was the rich coal basin around Karviná and the valuable Košice-Bohumín Railway line which linked the Czech lands with Slovakia. Furthermore, in north-western Cieszyn Silesia the railroad junction of Bohumín served as a crossroad for international transport and communications.\n\nThe casus belli for the war was the Polish preparation of national parliamentary elections in the area that had been designated Polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas.\n\nPrague's request that the Poles cease their preparations was declined by the Polish government and Czechoslovak side decided to stop the preparations by force. Because the majority of Polish forces were engaged in fighting with the West Ukrainian National Republic over eastern Galicia at that time, Czechoslovak forces quickly gained the upper hand. However, Czechoslovakia was forced to stop the advance by the Entente, and Czechoslovakia and Poland were compelled to sign a new demarcation line and the disputed territory was placed under international control.\n\nThe final division of Cieszyn Silesia came in July 1920 as a result of the Spa Conference. In conclusion, the railway line connecting the Czech lands with Slovakia and the territory to the south of it were assigned to Czechoslovakia, while the territory north of the railway line was assigned to Poland. The region under the control of Czechoslovakia was thereafter known as Zaolzie, a name that basically means 'lands beyond the Olza river'.\n\nThe region was briefly occupied by Poland during the Munich crisis and later annexed by the independent Slovak state, but returned under Czechoslovak control after World War II.

The party was formed in March 1926 by the merger of a group of dissident National Democrats known as the "Red-Whites" with various other rightist groups across Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nIt was distinguished by a strong current of opposition to Germany, which continued even after Adolf Hitler had come to power. The NOF instead looked to Italy as its model, and based itself wholly on Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In this respect it differed markedly from its chief rival 'Vlajka', which was firmly in the Hitler camp.\n\nGroups targeted by the NOF for criticism included the Jews, communists, the Czechoslovak government and the Magyars. It set up a youth group and a trade union movement, although the latter was minor.\n\nThe group also advocated a policy of Pan-Slavism, and hoped to take a joint lead with Poland of a grand Slavic alliance that would overthrow communism in the Soviet Union. They also believed in a corporatist economy with a large agricultural sector. The NOF attracted some early support from veterans of the Czechoslovak Legions.\n\nThe party failed to maintain its support, and received only 2% of the vote and seven seats in National Council in the elections of 1935. It was eventually disabanded and during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring most of NOF existence, it was led by former general and hero of Czechoslovak Legion in Russia, Radola Gajda. In 1933 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank and pension due to so called 'Zidenice Mutiny' scandal, a failed military coup done by certain fascist elements in the military.\n\nGajda was marginalized during the 1939-1945 occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers to flee into Poland and by hiding the resistance activities of his son. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment.\n\nWhen the World War II ended, Gajda was imprisoned by the NKVD and interrogated under harsh conditions. In April 1947 he was brought to trial for 'propagation of Fascism and Nazism', for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda's guilt was far from clear and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly thereafter. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later."

The Mission, headed by a former British cabinet minister Lord Runciman, was sent to mediate in a dispute between the Government of Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten German Party (SdP), representing the radicalised ethnic German minority within the country. The British mediators were active on the ground in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September.\n\nThe report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated [GetDateText], was strongly hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report placed the responsibility for the breakdown in negotiations very firmly on the SdP leadership who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Beneš’s 'Fourth Plan' proposals met “almost all the requirements” of the SdP’s demands. Nevertheless, when itemising the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was “a hard thing to be ruled by an alien race”. Although declaring that Czech rule was “not actively oppressive, and certainly not ‘terroristic’”, the report alleged “it was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination”.\n\nHowever, should the Czechoslovak government solve the Sudetenland problem before the escallation of the ethnic-conflict, the report of the Runciman Mission would probably turn favourably for Czech side and thus United Kingdom and France would be more willing back up Czechoslovakia against potential Hitler's agression."

When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) was finally establishedin the latter year, this outcome represented a compromise between the extreme, doctrinaire policies of the Comintern and the more moderate Czechoslovak-oriented views of Bohumil Smeral, the party's first leader.\n\nKSC organization was based on the Leninist concept of democratic centralism, which provided for the election of party leaders at all levels but required that each level be fully subject to the control of the next higher unit. Accordingly, party programs and policies were directed from the top, and resolutions of higher organs were unconditionally binding on all lower organs and individual party members. In theory, policy matters were freely and openly discussed at congresses, conferences and membership meetings and in the party press. In practice, however, these discussions merely reflected decisions made by a small contingent of top party officials.\n\nIn 1929 Klement Gottwald became the Secretary General of the party after the purging from it of various oppositional elements some of whom allied themselves to Leon Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.\n\nIn 1935 parliamentary election party held its original 30 mandates with little over 10% votes. However, the events of 1938 resulted in the party being banned, but it continued to exist as an underground organization.\n\nDuring World War II many KSC leaders sought refuge in the Soviet Union, where they prepared to broaden the party's power base once the war ended. In the early postwar period the Soviet-supported Czechoslovak communists launched a sustained drive that culminated in their seizure of power in 1948."

The militias were hastily equipped and set on alert during the communist takeover of power at the end of February. The name was soon changed to People's Militias.\n\nThe task of the militias was to protect against guerrillas expected to appear after the takeover, against undercover agents sent to Czechoslovakia and to cooperate with the police and the army. About 3,000 militiamen joined police forces. Non-communists were slowly removed from the militias. The control over the militias went to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nDuring February 1948 the militias obtained 10,000 rifles and 2,000 submachine guns from the armament factory Zbrojovka Brno. The equipment was continually modernized with sniper rifles, machine guns, mortars, anti-aircraft machine guns and transport vehicles. The ammunition was kept in army stores. During the 1970s recoilless guns and RPG-7 were added among the armament.\n\nAfter the communist party's fall from power at the end of 1989, the militias were dissolved on December 21, 1989."

The plane, very similar to Hawker Hurricane, featured retractable undercarriage and a standard armament of one 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub and two 7.92 mm machine guns in the wings. Avia engineers planned to replace the insufficient Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a stronger one, but the war prevented any modernization of the plane.\n\nAnother of the more interesting and promising designs was the Praga E-51, developed by ČKD Praga. It was a reconnaissance, heavy fighter that could also act as a light bomber, similar in design to the Fw 189 or the P-38 Lightning. The only known prototype flew first in May 1938, too late to be refined and mass produced for the use in the Czechoslovak Air Force.
