They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 ENG_submarine_3:0 "U급"
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean.

 AST_protected_cruiser_desc:0 "Laid down in the late 19th century, these protected cruisers of the British Pelorus class were transferred to Australia in 1912 and sold in 1922.  They were armed with eight 4-inch and eight 3-pounder guns, two 18-inch torpedoes and could make 20 knots."
 AST_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "채텀급"
 AST_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "Australia received three of Britain's Chatham Class cruisers, armed with eight 6-inch guns, two 21-inch torpedo tubes and capable of 25.5 knots, and with reasonable armour for the time.  These vessels stood the test of time, and while the last Melbourne class vessel was retired in early 1936, HMAS Adelaide, of the very similar Birmingham Class (pictured here, and built in Australia), saw service throught the Second World War and wasn't retired until 1949."
 AST_light_cruiser_1:0 "에메랄드급"
 AST_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Australia didn't purchase or build any light cruisers during the 1920s, but if they had then there's some chance they would have been similar to Britain's Emerald class.  Displacing 7300t, these were some of the largest light cruisers yet built, and at 33 knots also some of the fastest.  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 #AST_light_cruiser_1c: "시드니급"
 AST_light_cruiser_2:0 "퍼스급"
 AST_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Perth Class, sometimes also referred to as the Amphion Class, were very similar to the British Leander Class cruisers.  They had a modern design, with the eight 6-inch guns armament in four twin turrets, a speed of 32.5 knots and eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, as well as one seaplane for scouting."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "에든버러급"
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Australia did not order or build any more light cruisers of this type, but if they had it is likely they would have been, or been similar to, the British Edinburgh Class.  This class was more heavily armed and armoured than the Perth Class, with four triple instead of twin turrets increasing the main armament to twelve 6-inch guns."
 AST_light_cruiser_4:0 "넵툰급"
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour.  Had Australia built a light cruiser of this type, it is likely they would have used this or a similar design."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "호킨스급"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "켄트급"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Australia Class cruisers were the Australian orders of the British Kent class. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships, with HMAS Australia surviving five Kamikaze strikes during the war.  They were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets, but at 31.5 knots were relatively slow for a ship in this class."
 #AST_heavy_cruiser_1b: "캔버라급"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "서레이급"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "애드미럴급"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 AST_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "리나운급"
 AST_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3급 "
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "프린세스 로얄급"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_adv_dn:0 "퀸 엘리자베스급"
 AST_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII. Australia didn't order any battleships during World War 2, but if they had it's likely it would have been the same or similar to the Queen Elizabeth Class."
 AST_battleship_1:0 "넬슨급"
 AST_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "킹 조지 5세급"
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3:0 "라이언급"
 AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_carrier_ww1:0 "이글급"
 AST_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 AST_carrier_1:0 "커리지어스급"
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2:0 "아크 로얄급"
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3:0 "임플라카블급"
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_carrier_4:0 "몰타급"
 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by Australia, if Australia had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 CAN_submarine_2:0 "트리톤급"
 CAN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  Canada didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."

Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.

Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."

Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."

 NZL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Oberon was the first British patrol submarine developed in the 1920s, with intermediate range and six bow and two stern 21 inch torpedo tubes, as well as a four-inch gun. They heralded the beginning of the O, P and R class submarines that characteristed British submarine development at the time, and are the likely basis of any Canadian submarine force developed based on this model."
 NZL_submarine_2:0 "트리톤급"
 NZL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  New Zealand didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 NZL_submarine_3:0 "U급"
 NZL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.  New Zealand didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."

Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NZL_destroyer_1:0 "A/B급"
 NZL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Britain's first large destroyer class since WW1, had New Zealand decided to purchase new destroyers in the 1920s, it is likely that they would have ordered these vessels.  Faster and more heavily armed than the best of the WW1 destroyers, these vessels sported four 4.7-inch guns, two two-pounder anti-air guns and eight torpedo tubes, and could make 35 knots."

 NZL_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "더니든급"
 NZL_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Dunedin class were the New Zealand name for the British Danae class ships, improved versions of the excellent British C-class light cruisers. These vessels, like their predecessors gave valuable service in the Second World War despite being built in World War One. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. Two ships of this class served with the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 1925 onwards."

 NZL_light_cruiser_3:0 "감비아급"
 NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zealand designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs.

 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "New Zealand didn't build any 8 inch cruisers in the 1920s, but if they had they would likely have been based on the Kent Class developed in Britain. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships and were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets. However, at 31.5 knots were a bit slower than a number of other 1920s heavy cruisers."

 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "애드미럴급"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "처칠 도안"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers.

 NZL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3급"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The British G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament.

These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

 NZL_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 NZL_battleship_1:0 "넬슨급"
 NZL_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 NZL_battleship_2:0 "킹 조지 5세급"
 NZL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NZL_battleship_3:0 "라이언급"
 NZL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NZL_SH_battleship_1:0 "센추리언급"
 NZL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NZL_SH_battleship_2:0 "라이언 II급"
 NZL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NZL_carrier_ww1:0 "이글급"
 NZL_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 NZL_carrier_1:0 "커리지어스급"
 NZL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NZL_carrier_2:0 "아크 로얄급"
 NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NZL_carrier_3:0 "임플라카블급"
 NZL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck.

Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."

 RAJ_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_adv_dn:0 "퀸 엘리자베스급"
 RAJ_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 RAJ_battleship_1:0 "넬슨급"
 RAJ_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 RAJ_battleship_2:0 "킹 조지 5세급"
 RAJ_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_3:0 "라이언급"
 RAJ_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1:0 "센추리언급"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2:0 "라이언 II급"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 RAJ_carrier_ww1:0 "이글급"
 RAJ_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 RAJ_carrier_1:0 "커리지어스급"
 RAJ_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 RAJ_carrier_2:0 "아크 로얄급"
 RAJ_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 RAJ_carrier_3:0 "임플라카블급"
 RAJ_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 RAJ_carrier_4:0 "몰타급"
 RAJ_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by India, if India had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 VIC_submarine_1:0 "600 계열"
 VIC_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized displacing around 600tons though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of four ships were each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 #VIC_submarine_1b: "630 계열"
 #VIC_submarine_1c: "르두파블급"
 VIC_submarine_2:0 "미네르바급"
 VIC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (Project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale), a rather specific shipyard design of the previous classes."
 #VIC_submarine_2b: "오로라급"
 VIC_submarine_3:0 "롤랑 모리요급"
 VIC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean-going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 VIC_submarine_4:0 "피닉스급"
 VIC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 VIC_destroyer_1:0 "브라스크급"
 VIC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament was smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."

 #VIC_destroyer_1c: "애자일 & 보클랭급"
 VIC_destroyer_2:0 "르 판타스퀘급"
 VIC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."

 #VIC_destroyer_2c: "모가도르급"
 VIC_destroyer_3:0 "르 앵트레피드급"
 VIC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
 VIC_destroyer_4:0 "오슈급"
 VIC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 VIC_light_cruiser_1:0 "뒤게-트루앵급"
 VIC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 VIC_light_cruiser_2:0 "라 갈리소니에흐급"
 VIC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 VIC_light_cruiser_3:0 "드 그라쎄급"
 VIC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament, as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 VIC_light_cruiser_4:0 "콜베르급"
 VIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "수프렌급"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "알제리급"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "생 루이급"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "포르뱅급"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "듀랑-비엘 도안"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "덩케르크급"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 VIC_battleship_1:0 "쿠르베급"
 VIC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #VIC_battleship_1b: "브르타뉴급" 
 VIC_battleship_2:0 "리슐리외급"
 VIC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 VIC_battleship_3:0 "가스코뉴급"
 VIC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 VIC_battleship_4:0 "알자스급"
 VIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 VIC_SH_battleship_1:0 "사를마뉴급"
 VIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 VIC_SH_battleship_2:0 "나폴레옹 보나파르트급"
 VIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provided the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 VIC_carrier_1:0 "베아른급"
 VIC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_carrier_2:0 "조프르급"
 VIC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_carrier_3:0 "장 바르급"
 VIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 VIC_carrier_4:0 "클레망소급"
 VIC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
